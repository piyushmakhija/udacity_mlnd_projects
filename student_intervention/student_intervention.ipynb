    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "    - This algorithm is based on Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. Even though the assumption doesn't hold true in real-world applications, Bayes classifiers have worked well in projects for document classification, spam filtering. \n",
    "    - The advantage of Bayes classifier is that it works well with small amounts of training data like in our case where we have a training sample of 300.\n",
    "    - The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions because of the assumption helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "    - As the 'naive' in the name suggests, the assumption of feature independence can lead to low accuracy predictions in cases where the features are inter dependent.\n",
    "    - Because of less training data, this algorithm is a good candidate for our problem.\n",

    "        2. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. SVM\n",
    "    - Support vector machines are used in text categorization, recognition of hand written digits.\n",
    "    - SVMs are effective in high dimensional spaces and in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. It can also use kernels to learn non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "    - Disadvantages: \n",
    "        1. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "        2. The training part can be memory intensive and its prone to overfitting if given too many features.\n",
    "    - As there are a lot of features which can affect the prediction, we expect the estimator to be non linear and so using SVC with rbf kernel can give good results.\n",

    "3. Ensemble - Random Forest\n",
    "    - Ensemble methods combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator.\n",
    "    - The base estimator we are using is a decision tree classifier which predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "    - We will be using the random forest algorithm in which each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn from the training set.\n",
    "    - The variance of the estimator when trained using the random forest algorithm will be relatively less when using a simple decision tree.\n",
    "    - Decision trees are simple to understand and interpret as trees can be visualised.\n",
    "    - As a result of this randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree).\n",
    "    - In our case, we have multiple features which can be helpful to predict the target but if we use more than a few, we risk overfitting the estimator. Also, if we use only a few features, we risk making the model very simple which might not be accurate when tested on more data. Using the random forest ensemble method, we can use more features in the model and at the same time reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
